# Contributing to Cypherblock

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Cypherblock!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in Cypherblock? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Create a Bug Report

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/Cypherman1/cypherblock-eos/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, your next step will be to [create a new issue](https://github.com/Cypherman1/cypherblock-eos/issues/new)

Your issue report should contain a title and a clear description of the issue at the bare minimum. You should include as much relevant information as possible and should at least post a code sample that demonstrates the issue. It would be even better if you could include a unit test that shows how the expected behavior is not occurring. Your goal should be to make it easy for yourself - and others - to reproduce the bug and figure out a fix.

### Feature Requests

Please don't put "feature request" items into GitHub Issues. If there's a new feature that you want to see added to Cypherblock, you'll need to write the code yourself - or convince someone else to partner with you to write the code. Later in this guide, you'll find detailed instructions for contributing to Cypherblock.
